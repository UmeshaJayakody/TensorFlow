    "## Supervised Learning (Learning with answers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea\n",
    "The computer is taught, like a student in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- We give data + correct answer\n",
    "- Computer learns the connection\n",
    "- Later, it can answer new questions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Think like this\n",
    "Teacher shows a question and the correct answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- Photo + label → cat\n",
    "- Photo + label → dog\n",
    "- After many examples, computer can say: this is a cat\n",

    "## Unsupervised Learning (Learning without answers)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea\n",
    "The computer explores by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- We give only data\n",
    "- No answers, no labels\n",
    "- Computer finds similar things\n",
    "\n",
    "## Think like this\n",
    "Give many toys and ask: \"put similar toys together\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- Customer data → computer groups similar customers\n",
    "- Songs → computer groups similar songs\n",

    "## Reinforcement Learning (Learning by reward)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Idea\n",
    "The computer learns by doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "- Computer takes an action\n",
    "- Good result → reward\n",
    "- Bad result → punishment\n",
    "- It remembers and improves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Think like this\n",
    "Training a dog:\n",
    "- Sit → treat\n",
    "- Wrong → no treat\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "- Game AI learns how to win\n",
    "- Robot learns how to walk\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Very short memory trick\n",
    "- Supervised → answers given\n",
    "- Unsupervised → answers not given\n",
    "- Reinforcement → reward given\n",
    "\n",
    "## How models like Gemini are trained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-supervised learning / Unsupervised learning\n",
    "First, the model learns from large amounts of text/images without labels by predicting missing or next words.\n",
    "\n",
    "This builds general knowledge about language and patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is basically a form of unsupervised learning (the model teaches itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supervised learning (fine-tuning)\n",
    "After the base training, the model is often fine-tuned with examples + correct answers (like question and good response pairs).\n",
    "\n",
    "This helps it follow instructions better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)\n",
    "Then humans rate answers, and the model learns which answers are better using reward signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a type of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, these models use a mix of learning techniques — mainly self-supervised learning plus supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback — not just one simple category."
