# TensorFlow Learning Project

This repository contains educational materials and code examples for learning TensorFlow, a popular open-source machine learning framework developed by Google.

## Overview

This project is designed to help beginners understand the fundamentals of machine learning and TensorFlow. It covers different types of learning paradigms and provides hands-on examples with TensorFlow 2.0.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Virtual environment (recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd TensorFlow
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # On Windows:
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install TensorFlow and other dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```

## Project Structure

- `module_01.md` - Introduction to different types of machine learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
- `module_02.md` - TensorFlow 2.0 introduction covering graphs, sessions, tensors, and basic concepts
- `module_02.py` - Python code examples for TensorFlow basics
- `logs.txt` - Log file for tracking learning progress or errors
- `README.md` - This file

## Modules

### Module 1: Types of Learning
Learn about the three main types of machine learning:
- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through trial and error with rewards

### Module 2: TensorFlow Fundamentals
Introduction to TensorFlow 2.0 including:
- How TensorFlow works (Graphs and Sessions)
- Installation and setup
- Tensor representation
- Tensor shapes and ranks
- Different types of tensors

## Usage

1. Start with `module_01.md` to understand machine learning concepts
2. Read `module_02.md` for TensorFlow introduction
3. Run the code examples in `module_02.py`
4. Experiment with your own TensorFlow code

You can also use Google Colab for an interactive experience without local installation.
